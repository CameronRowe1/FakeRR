        <h4>Hi! Are you a recruiter looking for an assignment for front-end candidates?</h4>
            Use this API to test their skills.
            <br> 
            Ask them to write an application to fetch the data, and design their own UI response.
            <p>For developers testing their new language or new skills,
            try calling these API to test how your new front-end environment 
            would work with HTTP requests and responses.</p>



<h3>Make a request for a single user</h3>
<code>GET /api/users/2</code>
<pre>Send a GET request, with no body to /api/users/{id} where id is a user id existing in our list (see below). A user detail will in the response's data object.
</pre>

<pre></pre>
<h4>Response</h4> 
<pre>
    {
        "status": 1,
        "data": {
          "id": 2,
          "email": "janet.weaver@reqres.in",
          "first_name": "Joe",
          "last_name": "Smith",
          "phone": "1234567890",
          "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/2-image.jpg"
        }
      }




Successful request (id = 2 exists) will give you this JSON object:

Unsuccessful request like id = -3, will send a simple status of 0, and no further data.

    {
      "status": 0
    }

 ### 2. GET /api/users/
Send a GET request, with no body to **/api/users/** to get a list of user data existing in our list (see below)

<h4>Response</h4>
Successful request (correct url query) will give you this JSON object:
</pre>
    {
      "status": 1,
      "data": [
        {
          "id": 2,
          "email": "janet.weaver@reqres.in",
          "first_name": "Joe",
          "last_name": "Smith",
          "phone": "1234567890",
          "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/2-image.jpg"
        },
        {
          "id": 3,
          "email": "jane@reqres.in",
          "first_name": "Jane",
          "last_name": "Smith",
          "phone": "1234567890",
          "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/2-image.jpg"
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "email": "jim@reqres.in",
          "first_name": "Jim",
          "last_name": "Smith",
          "phone": "1234567890",
          "avatar": "https://reqres.in/img/faces/2-image.jpg"
